First-tier bondholders, owed $451 million, say they represent more than 99 percent of creditors’ economic interest in the case. In the motion to be argued Sept. 22, the bondholders say they will vote against the plan, which they claim is fatally defective.

Pro also sided with the bankruptcy judge by ruling that the lack of a market doesn’t preclude the use of cramdown. Otherwise, Pro said, “a plan would not be capable of confirmation when things are at their worst, which is not the intent of the Bankruptcy Code.”  Pro found fault with the bankruptcy judge in deciding whether the plan properly utilized one of the alternatives allowing cramdown. Full cash payment after three years doesn’t satisfy the first alternative, which permits cramdown if the bankrupt makes deferred cash payments.  The second alternative, a sale, wasn’t applicable, so Pro looked at the third alternative, so-called indubitable equivalent.  Pro said that the bankruptcy judge hadn’t made a finding about whether the plan provided the indubitable equivalent of the value of the claim."

Activist money managers are filling an information void created by rules limiting disclosures by publicly traded companies, said Gabelli, who oversees about $36 billion from Rye, New York. At the same time, regulation of short sellers and speculators who specialize in debt could improve, he said. “The free market is at its best when everybody works in a fishbowl and tells you their point of view,” Gabelli said today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “The hedge funds and portfolio managers have a right to do this,” he said."

Einhorn’s prescription for Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is “brilliant,” Gabelli said. The hedge-fund manager sued the iPhone maker as part of a push to get the company to create a new class of dividend-paying preferred stock. A judge sided with Einhorn in a ruling last week."

Using cramdown, the bankruptcy judge in Las Vegas confirmed a plan over the “no” vote of the lender.  The plan provided that interest would accrue at the 9.5 percent contract rate for three years. If the lender wasn’t previously paid in full by a sale or refinancing, the new note would come due in three years. By maturity, the loan and interest would total about $21 million.

Pro ruled that the bankruptcy judge didn’t make clearly erroneous findings of fact when he concluded the property was intrinsically worth enough to cover the debt at maturity with a cushion.

The bankruptcy judge also concluded that secured lenders with liens on inventory rendered Paramount’s claim unsecured because the inventory wouldn’t pay lenders in full. The bankruptcy court ruled that 2005 amendments to bankruptcy law didn’t create a separate federal claim for reclamation creditors."

The bankruptcy judge signed an order last week dismissing the case “without prejudice.” Dillard’s said that the shopping center owner has few creditors and contended that Chapter 11 was being used impermissibly as a litigation tactic. The Chapter 11 case stopped Little Rock, Arkansas-based Dillard’s from terminating the lease.  Highland Mall, opened in 1971, was the first enclosed, air- conditioned mall in Austin."

Using cramdown, the bankruptcy judge in Las Vegas confirmed a plan over the “no” vote of the lender.  The plan provided that interest would accrue at the 9.5 percent contract rate for three years. If the lender wasn’t previously paid in full by a sale or refinancing, the new note would come due in three years. By maturity, the loan and interest would total about $21 million.  On appeal, U.S. District Judge Philip M. Pro ruled that the bankruptcy judge didn’t make clearly erroneous findings of fact when he concluded the property was intrinsically worth enough to cover the debt at maturity with a cushion. The bankruptcy judge admitted there was no market for the land at the time of confirmation."

Activist money managers are filling an information void created by rules limiting disclosures by publicly traded companies, said Gabelli, who oversees about $36 billion from Rye, New York. At the same time, regulation of short sellers and speculators who specialize in debt could improve, he said. “The free market is at its best when everybody works in a fishbowl and tells you their point of view,” Gabelli said today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “The hedge funds and portfolio managers have a right to do this,” he said."

While Wall Street brokerages used to fill the role, “We’ve muted the analysts and their presence in the system,” he said. The prominence of activist investors has risen this year as Greenlight Capital Inc. founder Einhorn urged Apple Inc. (AAPL) to return cash to shareholders and Ackman, of Pershing Square Group LLC, and Carl Icahn took opposing positions on Herbalife Ltd. Einhorn’s prescription for Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is “brilliant,” Gabelli said. The hedge-fund manager sued the iPhone maker as part of a push to get the company to create a new class of dividend-paying preferred stock. A judge sided with Einhorn in a ruling last week."

The plan by Oaktree and Angelo Gordon would enable the companies to emerge from reorganization while fraudulent transfer lawsuits continue over the second part of the $13.7 billion leveraged buyout led by Sam Zell in 2007. Creditors can file plans because Tribune’s exclusive right to propose a reorganization expired in June after 18 months in Chapter 11.  The plan proponents said they will participate and are hopeful court-ordered mediation beginning Sept. 26 will bring agreement on a plan."

           "Gabelli Says Market Helped by Activist Stands: Tom Keene.Investors such as Bill Ackman and David Einhorn, who buy stakes in companies and push management for change, are good for the market, according to Mario Gabelli , founder of Gamco Investors Inc. Activist money managers are filling an information void created by rules limiting disclosures by publicly traded companies, said Gabelli, who oversees about $36 billion from Rye, New York. At the same time, regulation of short sellers and speculators who specialize in debt could improve, he said. “The free market is at its best when everybody works in a fishbowl and tells you their point of view,” Gabelli said today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “The hedge funds and portfolio managers have a right to do this,” he said."

           "The Disney agreement also provides Lovefilm with newer movies like “Tron: Legacy” to offer for a pay-per-view fee, the company said. Seattle-based Amazon, which acquired Lovefilm in January, started a U.S. service to compete with Netflix in February with 5,000 movies and TV shows. The subscription service is an add-on to Amazon Instant Video, which offers more than 90,000 movies and TV shows to buy or rent. Lovefilm’s U.K. subscribers pay as much as 19.39 pounds a month for unlimited mail and streaming viewing of films, TV shows and games."
